   - ✅ @types/js-yaml for TypeScript support
   - ✅ Docker build process working
   - ✅ UI compilation successful

### 🧪 Tested Functionality

#### API Endpoints Working:
- ✅ `GET /health` - Service health check
- ✅ `GET /api/v1/standards` - List tag standards
- ✅ `POST /api/v1/standards` - Create tag standard with validation
- ✅ `POST /api/v1/standards/validate` - Real-time YAML validation
- ✅ `PUT /api/v1/standards/:id` - Update tag standard with validation

#### UI Features Working:
- ✅ Standard selection dropdown in Operations page
- ✅ Create New standard button opens editor
- ✅ Edit existing standard button
- ✅ Form Editor with dynamic tag management
- ✅ YAML Editor with syntax highlighting
- ✅ Real-time validation with visual feedback:
  - 🟡 Validating (spinner)
  - ✅ Valid (green checkmark)
  - ❌ Invalid (red X with error message)
- ✅ Mode switching preserves data integrity

#### Database Management:
- ✅ SQLite database with persistent named volume
- ✅ `docker-compose down -v` resets database cleanly
- ✅ Automatic database migrations on startup
- ✅ Proper permissions for non-root user

### 🚀 How to Use

#### Start the Demo:
```bash
docker-compose down -v  # Reset if needed
docker-compose --profile ui up -d
```

#### ✅ Context Cancellation Fix Applied
The operation execution now uses `context.Background()` to prevent context cancellation when HTTP requests complete, ensuring operations run to completion successfully.

#### Access the Application:
- **UI**: http://localhost:8080
- **API**: http://localhost:8080/api/v1
- **Health**: http://localhost:8080/health

#### Test Tag Standard Creation:

1. **Via UI**:
   - Go to Operations page
   - Click "➕ Create New" button
   - Choose between Form Editor or YAML Editor
   - Build your standard with real-time validation
   - Save and use in operations

2. **Via API**:
   ```bash
   # Validate YAML content
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/standards/validate \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"content": "your yaml here", "cloud_provider": "aws"}'
   
   # Create standard
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/standards \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name": "My Standard", "cloud_provider": "aws", "content": "yaml content"}'
   ```

### 📋 Demo Deployment

The `/demo-deployment` directory contains a complete AWS infrastructure example:
- Multi-tier application (VPC, EC2, RDS, S3, ALB)
- Security groups and IAM roles
- Tag validation standard file
- Ready for terratag operations

### 🔄 Reset Environment

```bash
docker-compose down -v  # Removes containers and volumes
docker-compose --profile ui up -d  # Fresh start
```

### 🎉 Summary
